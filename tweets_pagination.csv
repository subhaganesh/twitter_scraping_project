@TwitterSupport,"We had planned for Fleets to help people feel comfortable joining the conversation in a low-pressure way, but it turns out Fleets were mainly used by those Tweeting the most. So now we're ready to explore other ways for people to share on Twitter. (2/4)"
@TwitterSupport,We learned a lot from Fleets and we’re excited to focus on newer and better ways to start conversations on Twitter. We’re proud of the work so far and have no plans of slowing down. (3/4)
@TwitterSupport,"Taking big chances helps us make the best product possible for you, but it doesn't always work out like we planned. It’s not always easy to say goodbye to a feature like Fleets, but we’re excited to get back to work on what we’ve got planned next: https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/goodbye-fleets.html… (4/4)"
@ladyofacat,"Please let us have multiple gifs per tweet I’m begging on my knees. It would be such a popular feature, everyone would love it especially me"
@TwitterSupport,"Hi, Anita. We appreciate your suggestion and will send your feedback to the team."
@fluffykittensox,I’m impressed that you have actually taken note of what didn’t work and also listened to the populace. Thank you for that it’s appreciated.
@TwitterSupport,
@BackupKy1e,"Hi @TwitterSupport , I filed a DMCA counter-notification over 10 days ago and never got a notice. This means that my account (@Ky1eWRLD) should have been unsuspended. However, it is still locked. Please unlock my account because it is now in good standing. Case # 0203668923"
@ItemsENABLED,Still waiting for the edit button
@ DreamHack Melbourne,"What about Super Follows, Spaces, and other upcoming products?"
@NickTurner13,"How about getting rid of racists, where's that on your list of priorities?"
@jkkcult,"Please @TwitterSupport Can u unblock my acc @jikookculture ? I really didn't violated any Twitter rules, I am having issues to reset my password cause I don't have email registred to it, just phone number, and it doesn't work. Please help me, this acc it's really important to me!"
@iHasan_7,Goodbye fleets I don't like it anyway
@annmarimaukonen,"I wish it was as easy to say Goodbye to all those bullies on Twitter, but they seem only to get like a 12hrs suspended account. Then they're at it again."
@mariaholley,An edit button would make us happy :)
@bruttafica,How about a edit option?!!!
@dognamedblue,Been here since '08 a no nothing about Fleet... there might be the problem... ?
@DAVIDKATZ_,Twitter help me I need help I have problems.
@VikingLander11,How about something that blocks tweets from Americans? I am in Canada and I get a lot of stuff from American sites and my trending and topics to follow are mostly American centered. Honestly? Could use a little less USA in my Twitter.
@CheNePensi_HahQ,@TwitterSupport Free @iostocondifra #0174477236 ................................................................................................................................................
@themrvels,Hi @TwitterSupport my account @caroldenvrs got suspended could you please consider and unsuspend it? I appealed the suspension via the Help Center form but obtained no response. Case #0197146719 and #0210740369
@dahlila,Buh-bye.
@nbranche,Interesting. I hope @Twitter doesn’t kill off voice tweets before I get to try it…that feature launched before fleets and I never got around to fleeting
@dumbledong,Hey @twittersupport my business account (580k) was suspended due to false copyright claims @ellebrookeuk . I successfully appealed all claims and was told after 10 business days my account would be reinstated. I still haven’t obtained any response. Please help #0211860185
user,text
@TwitterSupport,Thanks for sticking with us. We're experiencing a rise in cases and our team is working quickly to respond as soon as they can.
@ThomBartley,"Please don’t pull a @mosseri and hit us with a “we’re not longer a short message sharing app”. Insta lost its way because all it does is steal other people’s ideas (Stories = worked, push towards video / shopping doesn’t) Hope you come up with something original / good"
@alone_rider1212,Plz add reel option like ig and you tube Thank you
@joelvmills,"I’d like to see recent tweets in time order. When reading Twitter around an activity or event news, sport or whatever I want to see up to date commentary not yesterday’s tweets. The ICYMI function was better than a jumbled chronology."
@nhfabioo,Something is not working on my twitter account! I can't see the most engaged tweets when I click on the TOP section. Instead it shows the most recent ones! Help me!
@Let_Anita,Does that mean everyone will get the Spaces Tab before then? Or how will they know which Spaces are live when not in Fleets?
mcc@mastodon.social,"Okay but let us remove the fleets bar, it sounds like you're just going to leave a list of ""spaces"" there and I don't want to see a list of ""spaces"" either"
@althel7,احسن، بعضهم كل يوم ينزل كومة تغريدات ويصور تغريداته ويحطها فلييت! باقي يلاحق فيها الناس في الشوارع نشوف تغريداته. وشكله يرسل على قروبات الواتساب روابط تغريداته وفي الحالة على الواتساب
@Thunder_Owl,Thank You for throwing that out.
@chaoaretasty,Please give me the space back that the fleets took up rather than replace what you show there
@lordfpx,"Finally, That was taking too much space on my screen."
@SkatesSongs,Thank you for listening. I use twitter because I like words. Not for pictures. The changes to the trending topics have been brilliant and are very much appreciated
@GatitaKicksAss,"Thank you for the update. Learning is a process. How about that ""Edit"" button?"
@Kathleenhamil15,"Fleets, we hardly knew ye..."
@Icebox551,maybe stop removing shit and actually implement an edit tweet
@NaSa2013NaSa,Thank you for undisturbing enduser Best decision you have ever made
@mikequinn_,Open up your API to third party clients like @tweetbot and you’ll get more adaption.
@iamonthenet1,What the hell is Fleets
@TheyLove_Chuck,Why y’all need 4 tweets to explain the shit. Just get rid of it
@redmeister81,Blue ticks for all. Sorted
@SweetyGogoi6,Why my this tweet is unavailable it's not any hate or other words i have used requesting you to please ger my tweet available and the reason why unavailable i have not used any bad word or tweeted any hate speech
@lalita_xsiempr,"Hello, please reactivate my account. is @yacque_espos I was suspended for copyright by mistake"
@TampaWoman1965,Can you provide a system for vaccine and political disinformation?
@kgradyback2life,Edit. Option. One that tracks original tweet so their are always receipts. Please and thank you!
@_garud_a,Give us back Moments for smartphones users.
@RaeCorson,Farewell fleeting feature
@3badista,Thank god
@hybridmoments97,Might be a good idea to look into better ways to remove the racists and trolls from your platform. That would help make it a safer place for shy posters.
@Incalculable888,Twitter for close friends seems like it will be promising
@shawnwenzel,"A feature I would love to see is a ""tweet sunset"" where tweets older than a year or two are only visible to you or people you follow unless you retweet them again. Would prevent trolls from digging up old tweets like recently happened to @itskerrii"
@Des_Caters,I hope you sacked the guy/team who came up with the idea
@Erick_O_Mokua,"That is a sober,great http://move.How about giving us a character limit of say 250 per tweet instead of somebody doing so many tweets explaining a topical issue?It will be a great move I believe."
@CatholicJosh122,An edit button. Now. Signed - LITERALLY. EVERYONE
@MibIH,So maybe now you'll give us the Edit button every Twitter user has been crying out for since day one?
@AdamantxYves,Could you let us search through our media galleries when we're trying to post pics and vids? They're never in order when I try.
@SnakeCharmers,You can improve Twitter with an EDIT button. That's number 1.
@kannemaznn,"hello, @TwitterSupport i'm writing to say that my account has been suspended for over a month, it was suspended on 06/02, i've resorted in all possible ways, but i don't get an answer at all, can you do something ? case #0211230447"
@DylWynWil,"#Cymraeg as a display language please. After all, if Catalan is there... #Diolch"
@Laer_Cito,"Why taking out fleets? Everyone used them their own way, it was a nice feature. Just let them have music and they would be perfect, really. But anyway, you manage things around here, so, we'll just miss them. Go for an interesting alternative, yeah? Pls? #notwithoutfleets"
@vsnthdev,"If you could support basic markdown like headings, and other text emphasis... It would be awesome Threads on Twitter can be much more expressive."
@elemsee,"Going by the responses, perhaps you should beef up customer service and responding to suspension issues."
@CerebralPalsite,"How about putting tweets in chronological order and stopping promoted tweets taking up more of my timeline then people I actually want to follow? Oh, I forgot. It’s whatever makes the most money first before what actual users want. Moving on."
Robs Podcast Mug @robspodcastmug@tenforward.social,Now would be a good time for that edit button
@Lindas_Here,"Here’s a novel idea…..an EDIT button! Even one that only gives you a minute or two to edit your tweet! I know it’s possible, because I had a forum with that feature before. Get with the program twitter!"
@eroipu_yakai,"Hi @TwitterSupport , my account @kusokyomu and @Web26735457 got suspended and it never violated the Twitter rules. I appealed the suspension via the Help Center but obtained no response. It's been a month. Could you please consider and unsuspend it? Case number is #0217540559 Thx."
@HwfM_,Explicitly copying a feature from multiple other platforms isn't taking a risk. Why pat yourself on the back for plagiarism?
@michellegraz,Here’s an idea - give us an edit button
@ohayoo2018,"Hey I've been using Twitter since 2008. It's ok.Sometimes things don't go well. You know what, we need edit function. I prefer simpler Twitter as it was a decade ago. It'd be much better for us users to fully control our TL. Don't mess it around. Let's make a better Twitterland!"
@_Bkhshi_Amin,Zart!
@MustaphaMugisa,What if before such investment you ran a short survey about the featured customers would desire the most? And then refine based on the voice of the users???
@JR_Bee101,I would very much like to stop seeing peoples likes in my feed.
@bumblebeenush,"Now if you put in more effort into banning racist tweet accounts, that would be much appreciated"
@DogGeneticsLLC,Letting people format text on here has always led to screen reader inaccessibility
@ErikaWang2ndAct,#LoveTwitter
,
@ArizonaWildcat,How about an EDIT function? Duh!
@JasonBall34,The evil is defeated!
@percoset,why not just add more features to fleets
@c_r_5,"Tweets, but editable for 90secs after posting to correct a typo And not hidden behind a paywall"
@aldente_nogi,Hi! @TwitterSupport My account( @aldente_nogi )'s hashtag doesn't catch my http://search.Case#0220014088 Thanks!
@lisamcmullin,Can we please just have an edit button?
,@third_ojo make it happen
@RichLevy5,why not make a yes or no button that leaves or Takes off a post from newsfeed permanently!? Tired of always re- doing taking posts off that are not my taste or just offensive to me. How About fixing that?
@comrade_walther,recommendation to allow all mobile platforms including android to support voice recording
@PurpleT100,"Please put the timeline back to how it was before fleets, and don't fill it with Spaces instead. I've chosen to not use apps that are like your Spaces, so I don't want them on Twitter. Put then where those who use them have access, but out of the way of those who don't."
@PurpleT100,"The blog me tions ""full screen vertical ads"". Please don't. We accept you need ads, but the more they annoy us, like in full screen, the less likely many of us will use the app. Subtlety, rather than IN YA FACE, works far better."
@jooniesmoni,Please let us have a way to search old stuff from our bookmarked tweets and liked tweets as well...
